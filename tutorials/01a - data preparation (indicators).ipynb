    "In this tutorial, we will pre-process a raw dataset that has been prepared for the tutorials. These data come from the Sustainable Development Report 2022, but do not represent any particular country as I have chosen a sample of indicators randomly. The objective of the tutorial is to show you how to normalise and extract the relevant features from these data to calibrat the model of PPI."

This inversion is recommended to make the analysis easier to interpret.\n",

    "The <strong>bestBound</strong> and <strong>worstBound</strong> are the so-called technical or theoretical limits of an indicator. The former determines the highest possible value and the latter the lowest. In this tutorial, they will help us to normalise each indicator between 0 and 1. Sometimes, technical bounds are provided by the data; others, you need to determine them according to prior knowledge or expert advice. In this example, I have taken values from the Sustainable Development Report that are declared as the optimum and the possible worst. Therefore, strictly speaking they are not technical bounds. We will also normalise the technical bounds (turning them into 1s and 0s) to use them in PPI.\n",

Collateral indicators, on the other hand, are those for which there are no expenditure programmes, either because they simply do not exist, or because the indicator is too aggregate for any government to claim that they have a reliable impact their programmes."

    "* <strong>I0</strong>: the initial values of the indicators in the sample period\n",
    "* <strong>IF</strong>: the final values of the indicators in the sample period\n",

    "Parameter <strong>I0</strong> provides the initial condition of each indicator when running retrospective simulations. This means that <strong>I0</strong> is necessary for calibration. However, once calibrated, <strong>I0</strong> can be changed to perform prospective simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The levels in <strong>IF</strong> corresond to the last value that each indicator achieved in the samle period. Together with <strong>I0</strong>, this vector helps building the trend component that PPI will attempt to calibrate. Nevertheless, it is recommended to manually check <strong>IF</strong>, as it could be the case that the last value in the time series was the result of an exogenous shock or idiosynchratic factors (it would exhibit a behaviour that is not consistent with the indicator's historical patern). If that was the case, it is advised to adjust the last value of the time series in an attempt to better represent the trend component of the indicator, for example, one could fit a regreesion model or a Gaussian process and correct the last observation using the predicted value. In these tutorials, we will not make such verisication and directly used the final values reported in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The column <strong>successRates</strong> is used to calibrate PPI by minimising a second type of error different from the trend component. The idea is that the model endogenously produces a success rate that, on average, matches the empirical one. This means that one needs to compute, from the data, how often each indicator improves, in relation to the number of attempts to improve. For this dataset, in which we have more than 20 observation per time series, we can simply count how many times an indicator improved from one period to another, and divide that number by the number times it changed. Other ways to obtain this success rate include expert assessments or pooling indicators in the same categoty (like an SDG).\n"

In PPI's empirical applications, these parameters come from public indicators from the World Bank's Worlwide Governance Indicators.
